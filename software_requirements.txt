App idea: Reddit for College Students
Name: The Walking Devs

* Business Context
    * Mainstream platforms like Reddit host conversations on a wide variety of topics. This makes Reddit a good app for your average person, it also creates clutter and can make it difficult for students to find content that is relevant to them.


* Problem Statement
    * It is difficult to navigate such a large app with many users being from ages 12-80, with each generation bringing different topics, problems and issues. If we are able to take a sliver of all those different people, college students, it would make a much more useful app that college students can utilize. 
    * There are two problems this software will focus on 1) reduction of users 2) more appealing app to college students with resources for their issues and problems 
    * The solution will address these problems by making an app targeted toward college students. It will also contain topics and resources that appeal to college students.


* Scope
    * The solution will be available on a web browser.
    * In Scope: make sure the website it able to view on pc and mobile
